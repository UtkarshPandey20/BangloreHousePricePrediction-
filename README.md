# BangloreHousePricePrediction-
Banglore House price prediction Banglore House Price prediction.  It's a Machine Learning model which integrates Data Science and Web Development. We have deployed the app on the Heroku Cloud Application Platform. Housing prices fluctuate on a daily basis and are sometimes exaggerated rather than based on worth. The major focus of this project is on predicting home prices using genuine factors. Here, we intend to base an evaluation on every basic criterion that is taken into account when establishing the pricing. The goal of this project to improve the hands on experience on machine learning.  Technology and tools wise this project covers, 1) Python 2) Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning 3) Matplotlib for data visualization 4) Sklearn for model building 5) Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE 6) Python flask for http server 7) HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
